This isn't yet but will become experimental word finding code for use
in word game software. My goal is for it to be very fast and simple.

I haven't planned very far ahead but I'm starting to think that it
would be better to separate word-finding from strategy, and in the
future I might write strategy code in Haskell or some other language,
calling this library via FFI.

I'm also using this to create DAWG files for my Android word game apps.
